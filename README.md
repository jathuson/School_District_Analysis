# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of The School District Analysis
Maria and her supervisor were informed by the school board that the "students complete.csv" contains evidence of academic dishonesty for the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, which have been tampered with. They have sought Maria's assistance despite being unaware of the entire scope of the academic dishonesty and are committed to upholding state testing standards. I have been requested by Maria to to change the math and reading results for Thomas High School with NaNs, while maintaining the rest of the data. The school district analysis will be redone and a report will be produced of the adjustments and how they affect the overall data and results. 

## Results
### Impact on District Summary
The district summary was affected in the following ways:
    -the average math score was fell by 0.1% to 78.9%
    -the percentage passing math was fell by 0.2% to 74.8%
    -the percentage passing reading was fell by 0.1% to 85.7%
    -the percentage passing overall was fell by 0.3% to 64.9%

### Impact on School Summary
The Thomas High School summary was affected in the following ways:
    -the average reading score increased by 0.1% to 83.9%
    -the percentage passing math was reduced by 0.1% to 93.2%
    -the percentage passing reading was reduced by 0.3% to 97.0%
    -the percentage passing overall was reduced by 0.3% to 90.6%

### Impact of Thomas High School's Performance Relative to Other Schools
Thomas HS went from being the second highest school by overall passing percetage to only being tied for second place with 2 others schools due to the 0.3% reduction in this metric. 

### Impact on Analysis of Scores by School Spending Per Student
There were no changes in the results of the analysis on scores based on school spending per capita. 

### Impact of Analysis of Scores by School Size
There were no changes in the results of the analysis on scores based on school size. 


## Summary
The overall impact of the removal of the Thomas High School 9th Grade test scores was minimal across all aspects of the analysis:

    -In the district summary, there was a negligible (0.3% or less) impact to both the average scores and the percentage passing.
    -In the Thomas HS summary, there was a negligible (0.3% or less) impact to both the average scores and the percentage passing. 
    -Thomas HS remained second overall for passing percentage, however it was now tied at that level with two other schools.
    -There was a negligible (0.3% or less) reduction in the average scores at the 9th grade level.
    -There was no impact on the results of the analyses based on per capita spending, school size, or school type.

Although the results were minimally affected, I would still recommend to the school board to use the new analysis. It would maintain the integrity that they had desired and are committed to. The analysis is a more accurate reflection of district's performance and could be used for any future analysis.
